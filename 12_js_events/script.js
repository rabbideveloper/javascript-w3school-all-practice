/**
 *! JavaScript Events

 ** HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
 ** When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these elements.

 *! HTML events

 ** An HTML element can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

 *? Here are some examples of HTML events: 

 *! An Html web page has finished loading
 *! An Html input field was changed
 *! An Html button was clicked

 ** Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.
 ** JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
 ** Html allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to Html elements.

// 	alert("hello Rabbi");
// };

// document.getElementById("my-btn").onmouseover = function () {
// 	this.style.backgroundColor = "yellow";

// function showMessage() {}

//! JavaScript code is often several lines long. It is more common to see event attributes calling function:

//! EXample

// function displayDate() {
// 	document.getElementById("dmo").innerHTML = new Date();
